# Hamilton City Interactive Map

## Project Overview

This interactive map project is designed to provide users with a comprehensive view of Hamilton city's critical infrastructure and natural attractions. Utilizing the Google Maps API alongside a curated dataset from the city of Hamilton, this application dynamically places markers for hospitals, fire stations, schools, and waterfalls within the city limits. It's an excellent resource for residents, visitors, or anyone looking to explore what Hamilton has to offer in terms of healthcare, education, emergency services, and natural beauty.

## Features

- **Dynamic Map Markers**: Users can select different categories (Hospitals, Fire Stations, Schools, Waterfalls) to display on the map. Each category's markers are placed dynamically based on Hamilton's city dataset.
- **Interactive InfoWindows**: Clicking on any map marker will open an InfoWindow, providing more details about the location, such as its name and specific services offered (if applicable).
- **Responsive Design**: The map interface is fully responsive, ensuring a seamless user experience across desktop and mobile devices.
- **Data Filtering**: Markers are filtered by category, ensuring that users can easily access the information they need. Selecting a new category clears the previous markers to avoid clutter and enhance usability.
